The HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) tag is used to distinguish 
a page's structure and it's contents. 
Withing it's tag, lies everyting you wish for your sight to contain.
There are many different ways to further enhance your web page within 
the HTML tag using proper heading, title, and page break tags.
The HTML's job is to tell the users web browser what the content is, 
and how it should be displayed.

I have always been kind of artsy.
Some of my favorite media types are photography, ceramics, painting, 
and graphic design.
I really enjoy bringing my creative ideas to life,
physically and also digitaly!
I thought this class would be a fun and new way to show my creativity
digitally, and possibly sharing it with others too!
I am always looking for new ways to bring new ideas into my existing 
hobbies and thought that this would be an exiting way to do so.
My hope is to use the skills learned in Web Page Design in furthering 
my interest in media, and digital technology in a future career!
